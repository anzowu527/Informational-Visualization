## Graphviz
1. Generate a Dot language representation of a simple directory tree.
2. The directory tree is the tree that represent the files relationship in the docs folder
3. Apply rules for node coloring and shape within the Dot representation (details in the .ipynb).
4. graphviz.ipynb will output the Dot representation that we want.
5. copy and paste it to the Graphviz layout engine (see the following).
7. The picture in this folder is the output image

## Terminal input to activate the Graphviz layout engine:
